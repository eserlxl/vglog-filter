echo "✓ Removed complex locale manipulation code"
echo "✓ Simplified to use std::locale::global(std::locale::classic())"
echo "✓ Clean regex initialization with explicit flags"

echo
echo "The fix addresses the MemorySanitizer warnings by:"
echo "1. Setting the global locale to C locale before regex initialization"
echo "2. Removing complex locale manipulation that could cause uninitialized memory"
echo "3. Using clean, simple regex construction with explicit flags"
echo
echo "This should resolve the MSan warnings shown in the user's output."
