# Versioning Configuration
# This file allows customization of bonus points, multipliers, and penalties
# without editing the bash script. Use yq or jq to read this file.

# Base deltas for different change types
# Use strings to preserve decimal values for future micro-bumps (e.g., "0.5")
base_deltas:
  patch: "1"
  minor: "5"
  major: "10"

# LOC cap and rollover configuration
# rollover must be > 1 (renamed from "radix" for clarity)
limits:
  loc_cap: 10000
  rollover: 1000  # Three-digit rollover for better version management

# Bonus system - 7 categories with point values
# This is the ONLY mechanism for determining version bump types

# Decision tree thresholds - PURELY MATHEMATICAL
# These thresholds determine version bump type based on total bonus points
# No other rules or conditions apply - pure math logic only
thresholds:
  major_bonus: 8    # Total bonus >= 8 = MAJOR
  minor_bonus: 4    # Total bonus >= 4 = MINOR  
  patch_bonus: 0    # Total bonus >= 0 = PATCH (any change gets at least patch)

# LOC divisors for different change types
# Guard against accidental zero (division by zero crash in bc) by validating at load time
loc_divisors:
  major: 1000
  minor: 500
  patch: 250

# Bonus multiplier cap to prevent excessive version increases during large refactoring
# This caps the LOC-based bonus multiplier (1 + LOC/loc_divisor) to prevent runaway version bumps
bonus_multiplier_cap: 5.0  # Maximum bonus multiplier allowed (default: 5.0 = 5x bonus amplification)

# Pattern matching configuration
# Provides parameterised numeric thresholds for performance messages
# Consider making pattern keywords themselves configurable for team-specific wording conventions
patterns:
  # Performance patterns with numeric thresholds
  performance:
    memory_reduction_threshold: 30  # Percentage threshold for memory reduction
    build_time_threshold: 50        # Percentage threshold for build time improvement
    perf_50_threshold: 50           # Percentage threshold for 50%+ performance improvement
  
  # Early exit for performance optimization
  # Document in README: script should skip expensive LOC diff once bonus >= threshold
